      <h1>HTML Template Tag</h1>
      <p>
        The <strong>template</strong> tag in HTML acts as a mechanism for adding
        html markup to a page that, while it doesn't render immediately, can be
        cloned and rendered on the page later via javascript. HTML templates
        mimic the kind of templating previously done with libraries like
        handlebars or mustache.
      </p>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        In your html, include a template tag with a way to access the tag via
        javascript, an id is easiest.
      </p>
      <code class="snippet">
        &lt;template id="personal"&gt;Apply for a personal
        loan.&lt;/template&gt;
      </code>

      <code class="snippet">
        &lt;template id="business"&gt;Apply for a business
        loan.&lt;/template&gt;
      </code>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>
        An example of using templates would be an instance where you have
        choices for some sort of long-form content.
      </p>

      <p>
        Say you have an application where you have two different registration
        forms, one for an individual and one for a business. You can use
        templates to show the correct form depending on the customer's choice.
